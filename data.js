    body: "We tend to read miracles written in the Bible as stories told for our benefit. But truth be told, the Word is God is all about God, not about us. We tend to view miracles as to how it would help and encourage us but that’s just a small part of the Scripture. It is for us to believe in the One who is being introduced in the Word.In the story of Lazarus, people tend to see that it was for Lazarus’ benefit. That the story was all about Lazarus getting raised from the dead and how it must have been so cool for him to experience it. But no. This story WAS NOT for Lazarus’ benefit. It was only for Jesus’ and God’s glory!",

    body: "I have been away from the gym I work out at for over a year, last week I went back!  It was really great to see people that I haven’t seen for so long and to be encouraged in moving once again.  I am always amazed at the difference between exercising alone or in a group class. I sure work a lot harder when someone is leading and showing me what to do, and reminding me, I can do it!  I was thinking about the similarities between the reminders from the instructor and the reminders we have been sending out as a church to you. ",

      "“People of Israel, listen! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene....” - Acts 2:22...",
    body: "Here Jesus was described as Jesus the Nazarene. He was a man. Many in our society today think that Jesus is just an idea, or some kind of a philosophy or theology that is made up by man. The truth is and will always be this: Jesus was a human being who lived in the 1st century. He lived for around 33 years and did ministry publicly for 3 years. Jesus was a man -- in the flesh, a man who felt pain, emotions, hunger, and exhaustion, and was even tempted by the devil (yet, He did not give in to any temptation). He went through the normal day to day life of a human being and felt all the struggles of being in the flesh. ",

     "“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the Lord’s favor has come.” - Luke 4:18-19There are so many people right now who are going through tough times -- people who are oppressed, tormented, helpless, grieving, crying, struggling, and weak. People are suffering and are being pressed down, and for some, it seems like the torment never ends. During these dark times, some people tend to question God’s presence and God’s help. Where is God in the middle of all our trials? Does He really see our needs? Does He know our pains? Does God really care for us? Short answer: Yes. And while we may not always see and feel God’s presence working in our situation, we have to remember that God is ever present. He is always there with us, in every situation. He is working on our behalf. He never stops working. He never stops seeing. He never stops helping. He came to help and to deliver us out of captivity, oppression, and torment. Jesus came to set us free.",
